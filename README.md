## Overview

The ELSL++ Transterpreter is a customizable scripting translator tool designed to make programming more accessible for individuals who want to learn at their own pace, using their own words. Originally inspired by the ELSL to C++ Translator and based on the bat2html converter by PGD, this tool allows you to write code in a one language and translates it into C++ code or another of your choice via the drop down near Transpile button, ready for compilation via On the fly interpretation.

### Features

- Customizable syntax translations: You can define your own translations for ELSL keywords and symbols to target C++ code.
- Live Coding: Enable live coding to see the translated code update in real-time as you type.
- Dark Mode: Toggle dark mode for a different visual experience.
- Type Cycling: Easily switch between variable types (int, bool, std::string, etc.) with a keystroke.
- Save and Load Bindings: Customize your translations and save them for future use.
